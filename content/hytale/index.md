The Sweden Mayhem Hytale server is not what the name suggests.\
There is no anarchy here, no chaos. It is structured, stable, and built for the long term.

---

The experience stays true to vanilla Hytale while weaving in custom systems, mechanics, and items, integrated into the core gameplay rather than layered on top. New content surfaces naturally as you progress, expanding the experience over time instead of front-loading you at the start.

Instanced loot per player. Long-term progression for builders and explorers. Optional endgame content for those who choose to push further. Mysteries to uncover and systems to master.

---

Every Friday morning, all Wilderness outside claimed land is restored.
What you build remains.\
Nature heals, bringing fresh resources and loot.

---

The server infrastructure is hand-coded in-house, built specifically for this world, allowing tighter integration and stronger stability than generic setups. Mods are managed automatically, updates stage in the background and apply on restart, so the experience stays fresh without interruption.

Originally made for Swedish players.\
Everyone is welcome.
