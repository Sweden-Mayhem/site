# Service Update

Version <span style="color:#55FF55">1.7.35</span> brings improvements to the Information Board and menus!

<span style="color:#FFFF55">User Interface</span>
   <span style="color:#FFAA00">Information Board:</span>
      - Improved navigation between menu pages so moving around the Information Board is smoother
      - Deeper submenus added for quicker access to more options and locations
      - Menu labels can now show colors for clearer, nicer-looking entries
      - Button icons may appear at different sizes to improve readability

New deeper submenus were added to the Information Board; they may still have small quirks.

Thanks to <span style="color:#55FFFF"> b3cksgold</span> for the improvements!
