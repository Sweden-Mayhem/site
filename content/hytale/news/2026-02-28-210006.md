# Service Update

Version <span style="color:#55FF55">1.7.36</span> brings improvements to the Skill Tree, performance, and several fixes!

<span style="color:#FFFF55">Gameplay</span>
   <span style="color:#FFAA00">Skill Tree:</span>
      - Enchanting now grants Enchanting XP when you enchant items. Higher-level enchantments give more XP
      - The Enchanting skill tree has been expanded to 10 tiers
      - Empty tiers are now hidden so the skill tree UI shows only relevant rows
      - Skill tree text and reward displays now use your chosen language where available

<span style="color:#FFFF55">Performance</span>
   <span style="color:#FFAA00">XP Boosts:</span>
      - Servers with many active XP boosts should run smoother, reducing tick lag during heavy activity

<span style="color:#FFFF55">Bug Fixes</span>
   <span style="color:#FFAA00">Combat & XP:</span>
      - Fish caught while fishing no longer give combat or kill XP
      - Training dummies will no longer award combat XP when you practice on them
      - Elite mob nameplates and labels are removed properly when mobs die, preventing floating labels on corpses

<span style="color:#FFFF55">User Interface</span>
   <span style="color:#FFAA00">General UI:</span>
      - Fixed a conflict where the settings page could clash with other UI pages

This update adds Enchanting XP and expands the Enchanting skill tree — expect some small rough edges as we continue to tune it.

Thanks to <span style="color:#55FFFF">ziggfreed</span> for the improvements!
