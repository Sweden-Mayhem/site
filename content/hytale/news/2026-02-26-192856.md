# Service Update

Version <span style="color:#55FF55">1.7.28</span> brings improvements to the Information Board and in-game menus!

<span style="color:#FFFF55">User Interface</span>
   <span style="color:#FFAA00">Menus:</span>
      - Buttons on the Information Board and other menus can now send a message to you when clicked
      - Menu messages can use more colors (hex color support) so notices look richer
      - Links in menu text are now clickable for easier access to web pages shown in messages
      - Messages can include dynamic info like your player name and other relevant details
      - If a link appears in a menu message it will automatically be treated as a message and be clickable

Note: The new colored messages and clickable links are live and may have small issues.

Thanks to <span style="color:#55FFFF">b3cksgold</span> for the improvements!
