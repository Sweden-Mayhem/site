# Service Update

Version <span style="color:#55FF55">1.7.29</span> brings an update to how personal sanctums work.

<span style="color:#FFFF55">Gameplay</span>
   <span style="color:#FFAA00">Personal Sanctum:</span>
      - Some worlds and locations may now restrict creating Sanctum portals, so you might not be able to open yours everywhere.
      - You can still enter your Sanctum from inside it as normal.
      - Check the Information Board for where Sanctum portals are allowed.

Thanks to <span style="color:#55FFFF">Hazender</span> for the update!
