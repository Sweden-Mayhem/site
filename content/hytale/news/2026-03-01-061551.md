# Service Update

Version <span style="color:#55FF55">1.7.38</span> brings a small menu refresh!

<span style="color:#FFFF55">New</span>
   <span style="color:#FFAA00">Menu:</span>
      - New icons added to the in-game menu for Pets, Mounts and Discord to make those sections easier to spot

New menu icons (Pets, Mounts, Discord) were added and may have minor visual issues.

Thanks to <span style="color:#55FFFF">EllieAU</span> and <span style="color:#55FFFF">b3cksgold</span> for the improvements!
