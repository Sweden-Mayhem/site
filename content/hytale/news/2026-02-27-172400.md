# Service Update

Update <span style="color:#55FF55">1.7.32</span> brings improvements to support tickets!

<span style="color:#FFFF55">User Interface</span>
   <span style="color:#FFAA00">Support Tickets:</span>
      - If you have linked your game account to Discord, ticket linking and messages may now be handled through Discord. You will see a message explaining that account linking is managed there.

Note: Discord-managed ticket linking is new and may behave differently for some players.

Thanks to <span style="color:#55FFFF">winglessraven</span> for the update!
