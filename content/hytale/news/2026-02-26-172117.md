# Service Update

Version <span style="color:#55FF55">1.7.27</span> brings a small HUD tweak and an economy update!

<span style="color:#FFFF55">User Interface</span>
   <span style="color:#FFAA00">Skill HUD:</span>
      - Skill and combat HUD received layout and padding fixes for objective displays and level info
      - Added an objective focus option that keeps a selected objective highlighted until completed

<span style="color:#FFFF55">Other Changes</span>
   <span style="color:#FFAA00">Economy:</span>
      - Tweaked prices for several items purchasable with Dark Coins

The new Objective Focus option may still have small issues; please let us know if something looks off.
